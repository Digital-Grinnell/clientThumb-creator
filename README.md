# clientThumb-Creator

This project was cloned from https://github.com/Digital-Grinnell/worksheet-file-finder on 18-Dec-2024.  It's a new Streamlit app that examines all the files in /Volumes/exports/OBJs and creates new .clientThumb images from them for import into Alma Digital.

## Running Locally

Based on the guidance at [Run your Streamlit app](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/run-your-app) you can locally run your Streamlit app using:

streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
